# Estatio 
A real estate app called Estatio is created using the Rapid API, Next JS, and Chakra UI. With this, you can search or filter content according to your needs. Check out the relevant Properties Info.


## Getting Started

First, setup the .env file and get your api key from Rapid API:

```
RAPID_API_HOST=YOUR_API_KEY
RAPID_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
